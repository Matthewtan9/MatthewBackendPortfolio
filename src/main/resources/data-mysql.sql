There were times when I was absent, and he was quite reasonable, and we reached compromised solutions. His teachings were sometimes long because they mostly consisted of slides. The pros of this course mainly revolve around learning more about databases so we can effectively utilize them. The con would mainly be forcing ourselves to explain our assignments, as it can be a bit hard at times to remember certain parts of what we have done.');

A lot of the time, it was hard to follow the course, and he would also base his teaching off Christine. The pros of this course include learning how to develop an app using Swift, making it mainly unique. However, the cons of this course include not allowing us to bring a MacBook home. Most of the time, I had to complete my work at the college, which was annoying since I feel I could make the project better by developing it at home.');

After that project ended, I did the same for an ECP project in a team of 6. Personally, Bahman Zamani is not that great of a teacher, and I am sure many would agree. He would not be really useful because when I would ask how to fix a problem, I would never get a solution from him, unlike Christine, who was very helpful. Or when I asked a question, he would just repeat an answer that was not clear and tell us to “read the manual”. The pros of this course would be the change of pace from working individually to working as a team. The cons of the course are the teaching being a bit stiff.');

During the year, Brendan Wood was the one teaching us, but after the first test, it was Haikel Hichiri. Both teachers were nice and helpful when needed. They both explained the subject that is needed to make this course work. The only difference was the tests because Brendan Wood would make them harder. The pros of this course include doing the project with teammates using Raspberry Pi. It was fun seeing it work and detecting with a DHT humidifier. The con of this course was that it was hard to connect the database to add data inside it, but eventually, we figured out the solution, and it was enjoyable.');

Sometimes he could be harsh on us, but I am sure he does it for a good reason because he wants to see us succeed. The pro of this course is that it is important for us to succeed, and we learn more about how to prepare.

Bahman Zamani is the same as he was; he would just explain the basics of what we already know, and when asked real questions, he would simply say, "read the manual," even though we have already done so. Sometimes, doing diagrams is a bit annoying.

The pros of this course include understanding how data mapping works, and Nafi also mentioned that there are many job opportunities related to it, making it very useful.
